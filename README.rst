Seinfeld Calendar
=================

This is an implementation of the Seinfeld calendar concept as a standalone
webpage. It uses javascript for user interaction and saving and loading the
file.

Status
------

This is still in development. You cannot add, rename or delete projects with
hand editing the html. The style sheets needs serious work.

Features
--------

* Support for multiple projects

Bugs
----

* Fills out the table with days without regard for the end of the month.

Credits
-------

The project uses jQuery to make life a little easier. The implementation is
inspired by and borrows code from Tiddly-wiki.
